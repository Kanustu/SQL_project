# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Using the skills acquired in the last 6 weeks of the Lighthouse Labs SQL course to transform and analyze a given dataset

## Process
### Setting up the tables
- created the tables
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
- I discovered that the data, though incomplete did have information on the revenue, units sold, unit price, types of products sold
within several cities and countries. It also had information on the city and country of the visitors to the website, and some of their interactions with the website
- I looked for patterns and trends in the data to answer the questions that were asked
## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Lack of complete data sets
Lack of accuraccy between tables with seemed to be the same information
LAck of time to tackle everything I would of liked to
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Spend more time trying to understand what some of the data is actually representing
Spend more time cleaning up category titles and product names
Probaly try to clean up the all_sessions table, maybe break it down into smaller more manageable tables
userid, visitid, productid
