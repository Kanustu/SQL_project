# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The objective of this project is to leverage the SQL skills acquired during the last 6 weeks of the Lighthouse Labs SQL course to transform, analyze, and gain insights from a provided dataset.
Data Understanding and Exploration:

Familiarize ourselves with the dataset's schema and structure.
Identify the various tables and their relationships within the dataset.
Perform preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain initial insights into the data.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Convert data types where necessary for proper analysis.
Perform necessary data transformations to make it suitable for analysis.
Addressing Specific Questions:

Answer the predefined questions provided in the assignment, utilizing SQL queries to extract relevant information.
Analyze and interpret the results obtained to derive insights and make data-driven conclusions.
Exploring Additional Questions:

Formulate new, meaningful questions that can be answered using the given dataset.
Develop SQL queries to address these self-generated questions.
Uncover new patterns, trends, or correlations within the data.
Data Visualization:

Create visually appealing charts, graphs, or dashboards to present the insights obtained.
Use visualization techniques to better communicate complex findings to stakeholders.
Documentation and Reporting:

Maintain clear and concise documentation throughout the project, including explanations of SQL queries, data cleaning steps, and analysis techniques used.
Compile a comprehensive report summarizing the key findings and insights from the project.


## Process
### Data Understanding and Exploration
- created the schema and structure of the database using the given csv's
### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- details
### Addressing Specific Questions
- details
### Exploring Additional Questions
- details
### Documentation
- details
## Results
- I discovered that the data, though incomplete did have information on the revenue, units sold, unit price, types of products sold
within several cities and countries. It also had information on the city and country of the visitors to the website, and some of their interactions with the website
- I looked for patterns and trends in the data to answer the questions that were asked
## Challenges 
- Lack of complete data sets
- Lack of accuraccy between tables with what seemed to be the same information
- Lack of time to tackle everything I would of liked to
## Future Goals
- Spend more time trying to understand what some of the data is actually representing
- Spend more time cleaning up category titles and product names
- Probaly try to clean up the all_sessions table, maybe break it down into smaller more manageable tables
  userid, visitid, productid
