# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The objective of this project is to leverage the SQL skills acquired during the last 6 weeks of the Lighthouse Labs SQL course to transform, analyze, and gain insights from a provided dataset.

## Process
### Data Understanding and Exploration

I created the schema and structure of the database using the given CSVs. Initially, I set up tables with VARCHAR and INT data types where possible, to load the information and have a look at the data.

After exploring the data and gaining some understanding of its contents, I went back through each column to adjust the data types as needed.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
I utilized queries to identify and handle duplicates, nulls, and irrelevant information in the dataset, helping to ensure data accuracy. Additionally, I effectively used CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to transform the data as needed to address specific project questions.
### Addressing Specific Questions
I used my SQL skills to query the data and address the five primary questions presented for analysis.
### Exploring Additional Questions
I generated and addressed additional questions to dig deeper into the available data, extending the scope of the analysis.
### Quality checked results
I employed specific queries to verify if the obtained results fell within the acceptable range of answers. Throughout the process, my quality assurance checks failed on several occasions, enabling me to review and revise the initial queries accordingly.

## Results
I discovered that the data, though incomplete, did contain information on the revenue, units sold, unit price, and types of products sold within several cities and countries. It also included information on the city and country of the website visitors, as well as some of their interactions with the website. I looked for patterns and trends in the data to answer the questions that were asked.
## Challenges 
During this project, I faced several challenges that affected my progress. First, there was a lack of complete data sets, which made it hard to draw clear conclusions and make informed decisions. Also, I found it difficult to ensure accuracy between tables, even though they appeared to have the same information; they often had differences that caused confusion and inefficiency. Lastly, I didn't have enough time to tackle everything I wanted to work on. Despite these obstacles, I did my best with the available resources and tried to deliver accurate results within the given limitations.
## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would prioritize three things to improve my analysis of the given data:

1. I would spend additional time gaining a deeper understanding of the data's meaning and representation. This would enable me to extract more insights and draw more accurate conclusions from the information available to me.

2. I would focus on standardizing the category titles and product names within the dataset. By increasing consistency and accuracy, I could enhance the quality of my analysis and decision-making processes, leading to more reliable outcomes.

3. I would consider optimizing the structure of the "all_sessions" table. Breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tables based on user IDs, visit IDs, and product IDs. However, I would discuss the benefits of doing that with someone knowledgeable in this space before proceeding.
